Hello Mr. Galbraith.

I would like to begin by saying I tried.
I am at my wits end, and I do not know what is going wrong
I have spent hours working on this and at the time of writing this project is due in 5 hours, in which I do not think I will sucessfully find the answer to this project.
for some dang reason, my decryption algorithim is just plain not working.
I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to have to give up on this one.

if anyone actually manged to get this one done can you send me a link to their code? I want to see what they did that I didn't.
